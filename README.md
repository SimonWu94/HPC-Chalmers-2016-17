## HPC Collection ##
This is a collection of Hand-ins for the High Perfromance Computing course at Chalmers University year 2016-2017. [Here is the link](http://www.math.chalmers.se/Math/Grundutb/CTH/tma881/1617/assignments.html#optimization)

Most of the code can easily be modified to run on different machines. Usually just correcting the links to the libraries would do the trick.
